# eviction-analysis
This analysis is an attempt to illuminate some of the stories from the Eviction Lab data on evictions in the United States.

I give special thanks to SophieGarden - their analysis on Renter-Eviction-Predict was referenced often.

This research uses data from The Eviction Lab at Princeton University, a project directed by Matthew Desmond and designed by Ashley Gromis, Lavar Edmonds, James Hendrickson, Katie Krywokulski, Lillian Leung, and Adam Porton. The Eviction Lab is funded by the JPB, Gates, and Ford Foundations as well as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. More information is found at evictionlab.org.
